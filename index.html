                    <p>After spending 14 years in retail management, Tim has decided to get back to his roots of being in the tech field. He is doing this by attending The Coding BootCamp at UNC Chapel Hill. He is a graduate
                    of ITT Technical Institute, where in 1998 he graduated valedictorian with an Associate's degree in
                    Electronics Engineering Technology . He also takes pride in the fact that he became a member of the National Technical Honors Society because of his hard work and determination.

                    <p>Tim and His wife (Erin) just recently moved to Durham, NC where they are taking full advantage of expanding his knowledge base in computers . He strives to figure out how things work and expresses himself through creativity. As a former college athlete, he truly believes in the concept of “team” and looks forward to applying his newly learned skills of HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JQuery in a great team environment.
